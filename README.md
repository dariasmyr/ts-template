# TS Template - TypeScript Project Template‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏èüçâüå∏
TS Template is a TypeScript project template that provides a solid foundation for building TypeScript applications. It comes with a set of useful scripts, configurations, and development tools to streamline your development process. 

## Features
- Pre-configured TypeScript setup
- Ready-to-use linting and code formatting
- Unit testing using Jest
- Husky integration

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

`Node.js (version >= 14)`

`npm (usually comes with Node.js installation)`

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
npx degit github:dariasmyr/ts-template
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Mode:

To run the project in development mode with automatic restarts (using Nodemon), use:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Production Mode:

To run the project in production mode, use:

npm run start:prod
```

This command will build the project using the TypeScript compiler and then start the application.

```bash
npm test:watch
```

To generate a test coverage report:

```bash
npm test:cov

### Linting:

To check your code for linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
